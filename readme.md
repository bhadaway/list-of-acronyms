# List of Acronyms

Find the raw list here:

## The Goal?

I don't want to list every acronym possible, but instead something like the 1,000 most popular English-based acronyms. Common acronyms used for: chat, tech, business, TV channels, states, countries, government agencies, etc. Things that would commonly come up in conversation or article headlines.
